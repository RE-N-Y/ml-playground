The ML-Playground repository contains jupyter notebook files for kaggle dataset regression and classification problems that I have
conducted as a hobby.

To look into the specific approaches and data analysis I took, access each .ipybn file for details.
1. house.py file contains ML-model for solving housing regression problem. [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
2. titanic.py file contains ML-model for tackling titanic survivor classification problem. [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
